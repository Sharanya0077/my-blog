          Not all hurt in friendships comes from betrayal. Some of it comes from
          silence, neglect, and moments we don't realize matter. The things left
          unsaid. The calls not returned. The slow fade that neither person names
          until it's too late.
        </p>

        <p>
          This piece is about the small things we do or don't do that leave
          marks, even when love is present. The way we sometimes hold people at arm's
          length not out of cruelty, but out of our own fear or exhaustion.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've been on both sides. I've been the one who disappeared when life got hard,
          and I've been the one left wondering what I did wrong. Neither feels good.
          Both teach something.
        </p>

        <p>
          Maybe the kindest thing we can do is acknowledge that friendship takes
          maintenance. Not grand gestures, but consistent small ones. The text that
          says "thinking of you." The voice note on a random Tuesday. The grace
          we extend when someone forgets.
        </p>

        <p>
          These soft crimes don't make us bad people. They make us human, learning
          how to love others while also carrying our own weight. The repair matters
          more than the perfection.
