        <p>
          As a child, I wanted to be everything at once. An astronaut. A designer.
          A pastry chef. Each dream felt real, urgent, possible. The world was wide
          and I had all the time in it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Somewhere along the way, I chose one door and quietly closed the others.
          Not dramatically, not with any sense of loss at the time. Just naturally,
          the way rivers find their course and eventually forget the other paths
          they could have taken.
        </p>

        <p>
          This piece is about wondering not regretting who I might have been if
          I had chosen differently. What would my hands know if I'd become a baker?
          What skies would I have seen as an astronaut? What colors would I dream in
          as a designer?
        </p>

        <p>
          Maybe the doors we don't open still shape us, just in quieter ways. They live
          in the books we're drawn to, the hobbies we pick up in spare moments, the
          conversations that make our eyes light up unexpectedly.
        </p>

        <p>
          I think there's something beautiful in carrying all these unlived lives
          with us. They're not failures or losses. They're possibilities that remind us
          we are always more than the single path we walk.
